# Data Visualization 



## Plotly Basics

Plotly is a powerful Python library for creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations. I am going to create various types of plots and customizing their appearance using plotly.


## Features

- **Introduction to Plotly**: Overview of the library and its capabilities for data visualization.
- **Basic Plots**:
  - Line plots
  - Scatter plots
  - Bar charts
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Tooltips
  - Zooming and panning
- **Customization**:
  - Adding titles, labels, and annotations
  - Customizing color schemes and styles
  - Managing layouts and subplots
